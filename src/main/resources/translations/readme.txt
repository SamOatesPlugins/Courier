To use a translation, copy the config file you want as config.yml into the plugin data directory.

Do NOT edit any files in this folder, they are - always - replaced at plugin load.

For more information on translations, see the Courier forum: http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/courier/forum/30213-translations/

(Whenever you see an incomplete translation it's purely the fault of the plugin author having added strings no one has had time to translate yet)
